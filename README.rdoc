I had no difficulty implimenting the various queries required by this assignment. My modifications can be seen in member show and stock show. I did have some difficulty with implimenting the new gem I added to pull data from yahoo finance. the gem's readme was unclear on how to implement the api calls. however, I was eventually able to figure ou thow to use the the gem by playing around with the gem.
