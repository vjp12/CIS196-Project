Most of this assignment went smoothly for me. My only difficulty was that I changed the name of app from hw1 to homework1, which resulted in merger issues. Initially I didn't understand the merger error message or the <<<<<<< HEAD that appeared in my code. However, once the professor explained what they meaned to me during her office hours solving the issue was relatively simple.

<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
